My research is in algebra and algebraic geometry, and focuses on affine group schemes and related structures, such as various nonassociative algebras, homogeneous spaces and manifolds with 
exceptional holonomy. <br> <br>

I am the main supervisor for one PhD student, Isak Sundelius, since 2024. He is doing his PhD within the Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics, and his second supervisor is professor Magdalena Larfors 
at the Department of Physics and Astronomy. <br> <br>

A list of publications can be found in my CV.
