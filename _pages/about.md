I am a Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor in mathematics at Uppsala University. 

My research is in algebra and algebraic geometry, and deals with various aspects of affine group schemes and related structures. I received my PhD in 2015, and was appointed Docent in 2023.

I am passionate about teaching, and have taught a variety of courses for mathematicians, scientists and engineers. I was appointed Distinguished University Teacher in 2022.
