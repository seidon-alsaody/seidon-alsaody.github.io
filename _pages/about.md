I am a Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor in mathematics at <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/contact-and-organisation/staff?query=N9-61">Uppsala University</a>. 

My <a href="https://seidon-alsaody.github.io/research/">research</a> is in algebra and algebraic geometry, and deals with various aspects of affine group schemes and related structures. I received my PhD in 2015, and was appointed Docent in 2023.

I am passionate about <a href="https://seidon-alsaody.github.io/teaching/">teaching</a>, and have taught a variety of courses for mathematicians, scientists and engineers. I was appointed Distinguished University Teacher in 2022.
